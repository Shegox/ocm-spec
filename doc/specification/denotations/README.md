# 2.5 Denotation Schemes

A dedicated language binding typically provides structured elements
to describe the specification of an OCM [repository](../layer1/README.md#repositories) or
a [component version](../layer1/README.md#component-versions).

Additionally, tools and command line clients may support an appropriate
textual notation to denote elements to deal with.

This part of the specification describes a denotation scheme for
repositories and component versions that SHOULD always be supported.

## Repositories

## Component Versions

### Plain Component Versions

### Component Versions in a Repository
